# Snake_Game_Python

Ludo snake game 🐍 with python pygame library 🐙 ⚡ 🐱 = :octocat:


The snake game is a very popular and fun game. Every time the snake eats the foods, its length grows longer that makes the game more difficult.


About Snake Game Python Project 🐍

The objective of project is to build a snake game project. In this project, the snake can move in horizontal and vertical directionIf the snake touches itself or the border of the game then the game will over. tThe background music is added to make more fun and score will be visible as well. ( simple hack - it can also move cross directional with little bit change in the code 😂 ).
